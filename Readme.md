# Text-Classification-using-ML-techniques

An important challenge ahead of the Information Technologies and online services is how to
deal with selecting, filtering, and managing the growing amount of the information especially in the
form of text. Information Retrieval (IR), an automated information and knowledge management
system, is a proper solution which uses a bunch of sophisticated techniques to draw information as
accurately as possible. Categorization of the digital documents is one of the means of improving the
performance of the IR systems which allows users to benefit from browsing and finding the
documents they are interested in. Therefore, text classification (TC) is a sub-task of IR which plays
an important role in information filtering and retrievals as well as in the development of the userdriven web services and systems. Generally, text classification is the task of assigning digital articles
or textual documents into pre-set or pre-defined classes.
